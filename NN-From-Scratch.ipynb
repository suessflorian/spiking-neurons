    "# Explosion of NN complexity\n",
    "From my experience the field of deep learning has come a very long way - with rapid developments hitting since 2017 (where the phrase [\"attention is all you need\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need) was born). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Transformer](./images/transformer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Caption: the transformer model, it's legit - but nevertheless, purpose of this image is to instil a bit of discomfort.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The pace of development has since been commerically accelerated by the big tech giants today releasing their own iterations/refinements/advances. It's important to garner an appreciation for _how much_ this field has accelerated, iterations of models come with an uncountable number of processes/systems plumbed together in a way that makes it combinatorially difficult to explain how these systems in isolation interact with each other... \"it just works\" and in this attention penetrated stage of the [hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle) - it makes sense to ship ASAP models that tend to perform well regardless for it's exact internal workings. This has led to a full explosion in academia of [ablation studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_(artificial_intelligence)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Although this has been done countless times before, via lectures at University, Youtube videos, blogs etc... (best tutorial I have is seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)). I'd still like to be able to describe NN's from absolute scratch - reducing the problem to the following hierarchical set of concepts."
